## 🎯 Key Features

- 📈 Line charts for **Latency** and **Token Usage** (30-day time series)
- 🔁 **Retrain** / ⏪ **Rollback** model actions (simulated)
- 📊 KPI cards with day-over-day **delta**
- ⚠️ Alert and Drift Detection Display
- 📅 **Date Range Filter** and **Version Selector**
- 💬 Team Comment Simulation
- 🧪 Logs, audit trail, and mock data-driven decisions
